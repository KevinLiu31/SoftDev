## Noteable Notes:
  - The \<code\> tag can be used to format text as code.
    - To make html not do the thing where it ignores whitespace (like tabs and newlines, use the \<pre\> tag).
    - When displaying html code, replace \< with `&lt`, \> with `&gt`, and & with `&amp`.
  - Bootstrap is mobile-first, so the coolest parts are fully appreciated on a mobile device since one of the primary goals is to make things look nice on those devices.
  - We explored grids, dropdowns, navbars, and carousels, which are useful, pre-built elements (classes?) made to do commonly-needed tasks quickly (aka save engineering time).
